placement
=========

Condor-related scripts for performing actual placement

Creating a new placement test:
A placement job is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). A sample dag is defined in
the file placement4.dag. Which looks like the following:

    JOB A placement4-submit
    SCRIPT POST A /bin/false
    SCRIPT PRE A  createJobDirs.sh fl2mo
    VARS A EXPERIMENT="fl2mo" SRC_HOST="flashio-osg.calit2.optiputer.net" SRC_PATH="/home/idpl/100M" DST_HOST="mongo.mayer.optiputer.net" DST_PATH="100M" cron_hour="0-23/2" cron_minute="30"
    RETRY A 100000

There are several variables that define the placement job. Currently a placement job performs the following tests
 1. iperf
 2. fdt (fast data transfer)
 3. scp (secure copy)
 4. netcat (simple, unencrypted copy
 5. iperf


The parameters of the experiment are

|PARAMETER NAME |  Description|
|---------------|-------------|
| EXPERIMENT |  Name of the experiement. Name of subdirectory for data |
|SRC_HOST   |  Host **from** which data will be copied|
|DST_HOST   |  Host **to** which data will be copied |
|SRC_PATH   |  Full path name of the file to be copied |
| DST_PATH   |  *relative* path to which file will be copied |
| cron_hour  |  hours on which placement will occur| 
| cron_minute|  minute on which placement will occur|


To define new placement job
 1. copy placement4.dag to \<EXPERIMENT\>.dag
 2. edit \<EXPERIMENT\>.dag to change the above parameters on the **VARS** line
 3. edit \<EXPERIMENT\>.dag to change fl2mo to EXPERIMENT on the **SCRIPT PRE** 
 4. submit your job with `condor_submit_dag <EXPERIMENT>.dag`


The output file will be \<EXPERIMENT\>/placement4.log. Each successful placement will create a *writerecord* line.

*Note*: iperf reports Kilobytes.  The other tools report Bytes.

## System requirements

The placement scripts try to deploy as much of their infrastructure on the fly as possible.  The following 
must be set up a-priori, though:

* Condor, configured with static slots, with each slot's DedicatedScheduler attribute pointing to a distinct schedd
* TCP port 5001-5010 open
* iperf installed
* The openjdk java pre-installed (for fdt)
